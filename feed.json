That is, the neural activity in both cases occurs in overlapped areas. Suppose the neurobiological system shares identical features that notifies us of pain no matter what the cue is, and since Tylenol can reduce physical pain, researchers hypothesized Tylenol can alleviate social pain.</p>\n<h5><em><span style=\"color: #ba372a;\">Self-reported and FMRI scan of brain activation</span></em></h5>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">To be continued...</span> </span></p>\n<p> </p>",
